            </p>
            <h5>Story:</h5>
            <p>The play starts with the Bhulakshmi Devi, the child less queen of the king Nava Bhoja Raja praying sage
                Jatanga for children. The sage tells her to take just seven fruits from a mango tree in the garden and
                eat, and by doing this she will be blessed with seven children. The queen, out of the desire to have
                more children, plucks the eighth fruit from the tree. The eighth fruit was reserved to the snake king
                Nagendra. The snake king Nagendra, who guards the tree gets angry and wants to punish the queen by
                killing her. The queen begs Nagendra for life so that she can have seven children and then give away her
                life to him as repentance. Nagendra agrees to the queen’s plea.
            </p>
            <p>The queen gives birth to seven babies. The 7th child is Balanagamma who is very beautiful. Then, asks her
                husband to give permission to fulfill the repentance. But her husband refuses and abuses Nagendra. The
                enraged Nagendra enters the royal palace and kills the queen, for every person has to undergo the effect
                of the deeds.
            </p>
            <p>After Bhulakshmi’s death, the king marries Mandula Manikyamba Devi. The new queen tries to kill
                Bhulakshmi’s children out of jealousy but the mother’s soul protects and nurtures them.
            </p>
            <p>The seven maternal uncles of the Panuganti family marry the seven girls respectively. The youngest one,
                Karyavardhi, marries the youngest Balnagamma who later gives birth to a son ‘Balavardhi’.
            </p>
            <p>The evil magician Mayala Marati in his ‘ghosts den’ has lost passion for his fiancé Sangu. Now he wishes
                to go for the world’s most beautiful woman. He comes to know that Balanagamma is the most beautiful
                woman, and with his magical powers, transforms her into a dog, and brings her to his den to get married
                with her.
            </p>
            <p>Balanagamma’s husband Karyavardhi with his brothers comes in search of his wife. Marati turns them into
                statues. After nine years, the grown up Balavardhi, son of Balanagamma comes to know about the abduction
                of his mother and that his father went missing while searching for his mother Balanagamma.
            </p>
            <p>Balavardhi decides to find his parents. During his search, he kills a tiger, marries the daughter of the
                king of that country. On the direction of Nagendra (The snake God), he goes to Marati’s place. Here,
                with the help of an old lady Tamballa Pieddi, he enters Marati’s den. Keeping Marati under intoxication
                of liquor, Balavardhi meets his mother Balanagamma in the jail. With her help, he extracts the secret of
                Marati’s life.
            </p>
            <p>Balavardhi crosses seven seas and brings the parrot in which Marati’s life reserved and kills him. The
                play ends with Balavardhi’s union with his parents, Balanagamma and Karyavardhi.
