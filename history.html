                        in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh. She started her earlier education of acting at her father
                        Vanarasa Govinda Rao. She entered the stage in her 6th year and continued the expedition for 50
                        years. She grew to the excellence of acting as she accompanied the troupe when they travelled to
                        Rangoon and Burma.

                        actress who could play both male and female roles with unusual ease. The popular roles are Sri
                        Rama in Lavakusa, Balarama and Dhuryodhana in Kurukshetram, Yama in Sati Savitri, Vengalaraya in

                        and Satvika – the elements of virtuosity in a balanced proportion and Subhadramma had equipped
                        herself well in all these areas of theatrical exposition and gained a name for her excellent
                        acting abilities.

                        responsibility of training actors and actresses of her company and did justice to it with great
                        elan. Because of her inimitable rendering of poems with a stress on the bhava and her
                        mellifluous singing, she was regarded as one of the topmost actresses of her time.
                    </p>
