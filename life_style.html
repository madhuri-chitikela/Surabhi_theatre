            <h4>LIFE STYLE
            </h4>
            <p>Dramas convey the tradition and culture to next generations. There is a great importance of keeping
                dramas alive. Though there are many drama groups, Sri Venkateswara Surabhi theatre is unique. This is
                not an organization; This is a system which has travelled many years with discipline and dedication. Any
                other group can let live a play (drama) for some time; But this troupe makes the play eternal since this
                troupe is one family. The descendants inherit the Drama as their asset as well as the essence of life.
                For a Surabhi artist, Rangmanch (the stage) is the place of birth, Rangmanch is the responsibility to
                keep going on; Rangmanch is the school where the essence of life dwells, Rangmanch is the only meaning
                of the life. A Surabhi artist is an artist by birth. It quite understands if we know that most of the
                Surabhi artists brought on to the stage on their 11th day from birth to perform the role of
                infant-Krisna. They feel proud to have the opportunity to the babies to be brought on to the stage since
                it is the only noble life they know by heart.

                <h5>Progress</h5>
                <p>There was a good era that Surabhi family could lead the good economic life. But coping with the fast
                    technologies such as Televisions, Cinemas; these days, it is not so easy to get the maintenances
                    too. In 1996, Padmasri B.V.Karanth conducted three workshops for Surabhi with the contribution from
                    NSD (Delhi), RRC (Banglore), Spandana (Banglore) and Alarippu (New Delhi). The intervention of
                    Padmasi B.V.Karanthji made Surabhi to grow national.

                </h5>
                <p>The Popularity of Surabhi can be differentiating in two phases:
                </p>
                <p>The first 135 years: All the past years, Surabhi lead the nomadic life and most of the years went in
                    performing at villages. So, Surabhi was known for Telangana & Andhra villages very well. But the
                    economic conditions were poor enough to downsize the number of troupes. . And the education of the
                    children was quite disturbed due to the nomadic life.
                </p>
                <p>The past few years: When Dept. of Culture- Telangana gave a chance to perform our dramas in Telangana
                    & other places, In effect, the citizens, people of other states and foriegners habituated to watch
                    the SVST.Surabhi's performances. Which in effect gave good popularity to SVST.Surabhi thus,
                    Surabhi’s fame grew internationally. Not only that, the children of the SVST.Surabhi family got the
                    chance to perform on the stage without disturbing their education. There are kids who study the
                    primary, secondary educations, and there are young people who are pursuing post graduations, and
                    PhD’s., in Theatre Arts.
                </p>
                <p>In fact the 135 years of the popularity gained at villages is outsmarted by the past few years of
                    popularity. This rapid popularity gave Surabhi new hopes to move forward. Now, there is a fearful
                    thought that if Surabhi is to go back to the villages, it may loss its light and the existence will
                    be in question. in effect, the people will not have the opportunity to experience the unique art. In
                    order to let this system live, either the Govt.(of State as well as Central) or the other donors who
                    are admirers of drama should come forward and make it happen that SVST.Surabhi should have a
                    permanent theatre in or around Hyderabad.
