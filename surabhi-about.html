                    <h5>Roots:</h5>
                    <p>Surabhi is a rare institution of family groups that leads nomadic life by performing dramas in
                        villages. Surabhi has a track record of 135years. Most of the Surabhi plays are the compendiums
                        from the Indian epics and mythiologies Ramayana, Mahabharatha and Bhagavatha . There was a time
                        that Surabhi troupes could tremendously survived all over Andhra Pradesh. Sri Venkateswara
                        Surabhi Theatre which is well known as the Surabhi Jayachandra Varma is one of the survived
                        groups to till date.

                    <p>Vanarasa Govindarao
                        <em>(Founder of Surabhi)</em>

            <h5>First stage production - Keechaka Vadha:
            </h5>
            <p>The puppet team of the Vanarasa family had become very popular. Their shows became a part of any
                important ceremony either in village festivals or ceremonies in big families of rich landlords. From a
                village near Jammalamadugu, there came a call to enact a puppet show during a wedding ceremony in a rich
                Reddy landlord's house. The village was Sorugu, which is now called Surabhi, and the landlords were
                Allapureddy Chennareddy and Kovvuru Ramireddy(the former's daughter is given to the latter's son) who
                were known in the taluq for their munificence and were known patrons of puppet shows. Here, Vanarasa
                Govindarao found a good opportunity to convert the puppet show 'Keechaka Vadha - A tale from the epic
                Maha Bharatha' to a theatrical performance. Thats the starting point. With the huge success of the show,
                the puppetry family cahnged into a classical theatrical family. As the early plays of the group were
                staged at Surabhi village and since most of the artists lived in the same area, the group came to be
                known as Surabhi. .
            </p>
            <h5>Introducing women on the stage:
            </h5>
            <p>The contribution of Surabhi community to the promotion of Telugu theatre and culture is price less. It
                was this group that brought women to the stage fro the first time (Till 1885, the contemporary drama
                groups used to come up with the male artists performing female roles since the restrictions of the
                society didn't allow women to explore on stage. Since the Surabhi is a family system, women were
                motivated to perform the women roles on their own stage). It also popularised gramphone records,
                contributed actors to film, and took theatre beyond the geographical boundaries of andhra Pradesh.
            </p>
            <h5>Introducing ticket system:
            </h5>
            <p>The early plays staged by the group are Harischandra, Sarangadhara, and Sakunthala. The first to
                introduce ticket system, the gate collection in those days were as high as Rs.100. Thus the credit of
                making people buy tickets goes to Surabhi. by 1901, Surabhi began tours to coastal districts and even
                went upto Burma.

                    <h5>Introducing gimmicks and trick scenes:
                    </h5>
                    <p>Surabhi was a simply a Padya Natakam (classical Telugu verse play) until Sri China Ramayyah
                        introduced the gimmicks and trick scenes. In the long run Surabhi kept on enhance the trick
                        scenes. Surabhi takes resource to a lot of gimmicks, recreating old world charm on stage. The
                        audience witness to their delight, Lord Vishnu materialising on the stage to bless a devotee and
                        Narada traversing through the air, rendering 'Narayana Keertana.' Gatotkacha pours fire in stage
                        and Krishna dances on Kaliya, the five headed sanke. The present Surabhi is a small world by it
                        self. With in-built democratic principles and administration. The families of artists live on
                        the other side of the theatre structure in small apartments built for them. Women and children
                        have always been integral part of its productions. There is a seperate workshop to produce sets
                        and other necessary objects. The artists do moulding, curtain painting, cut-out designs, and
                        other works by themselves.
